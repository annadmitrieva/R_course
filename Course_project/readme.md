Project topic: What does collocations frequency in a corpus of academic texts depend on 
Hyphothesis: it depends on scientific domain.  
Data: lists of collocations with various measures (absolute frequency, relative frequency, PMI et al.) from different academic journals.  
  
I did not upload the lists to github, because the files are too big, but they can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k_N-DZ-nLL5ro66-LxIaE4-dRwirdwZh
