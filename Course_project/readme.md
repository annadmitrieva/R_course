Project topic: Domain specifity of collocations in Russian academic texts  
Question 1: Are the most significant collocations domain-specific?   
Hypothesis 0: top collocations are the same for all domains  
Hypothesis 1: top collocations are different for each domain
Question 2: Do collocation metrics actually correlate with the frequency and, if yes, how strong is the correlation?  
Hypothesis 0: PMI, t score and likelihood ratio do not correlate with the ngram frequency Hyphothesis  
1: there is a correlation between collocation metrics and frequency  
Data: lists of collocations with various measures (absolute frequency, relative frequency, PMI et al.) from different academic journals.  
  
I did not upload the lists to github, because the files are too big, but they can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k_N-DZ-nLL5ro66-LxIaE4-dRwirdwZh
